## Objective
Goal is to use Godot to create 2d Based platformer and figure out mechanics and Game Engine for a larger project.
For a technical Demo, we should showcase the mechanics and gameplay we intend to add into the finished project. 
Animations, more complex level design and story can be flushed out later.

## Current Idea
2d player charachter should have a melee based attack and a gun that gives recoil to the player on use. The gun can be ideally used 
for interesting platformer gameplay - accessing hidden or difficult to get to areas (by breaking walls or obstacles) or for additional manueverability (a double jump type mechanic)
or simply to attack or stop attacks from more dangerous foes. To prevent overuse, the total bullet capacity of the player is five.

## Next Steps
Organise and refactor current code to allow for more weapon options/the ability to switch weapons
Should also inherit basic methods for actors i.e the gravity and jumping options.
